# Pattern for Craft CMS 3.5+

Pattern is an ever-expanding library of bare-bone, accessible components for rapid development of Craft websites.

## Notes

* It uses tailwind
* All components will have a base style, this style will be overwriteable (that's a word right?) by a theme file, or by passing a `style` varible to the component.
* The theme will allow you to define a color scheme.
* You can use Pattern via a plugin, or just drag the `_pattern` into your template folder.
* It's a long way off being done.

## Usage

Don't. Unless you're me.
